# Telegram Registration Bot

A **Python-based Telegram bot** that **registers and manages staff members**. The bot allows users to register new staff members, delete existing ones, and ensures secure user interactions. It is built using the **PyTelegramBotAPI** library and utilizes **environment variables** to store the Telegram Bot API key securely.

## Features

### **Bot Management**
- **Staff Registration**: Users can register new staff members by entering details step by step.
- **Staff Deletion**: Allows users to delete staff members using a unique ID.
- **Environment Configuration**: The bot’s Telegram API key is managed using environment variables for enhanced security.

### **User Interaction**
- **Start Command (`/start`)**: Initiates interaction with the user and provides options for registration or deletion.
- **Step-by-step Registration**: The bot guides the user through entering their **first name, last name, email, and phone number**.
- **Phone Number Validation**: Ensures phone numbers start with `+998` and contain exactly 9 digits.
- **Error Handling**: Provides real-time error messages for incorrect inputs.
- **Secure Data Handling**: Uses a dictionary to store user data temporarily before adding it to the database.

### **Security**
- The bot’s API key is securely stored using environment variables, preventing accidental exposure.
- The bot does not permanently store user data, ensuring privacy.
- All messages unrelated to valid inputs are marked as "trash" and deleted automatically.
